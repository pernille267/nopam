\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.table} containing measurements.}

\item{from}{A \code{IDate} value. The start of the warning process, i.e., the first date where a warning is calculated.}

\item{to}{A \code{IDate} value. The end of the warning process, i.e., the last date where a warning is calculated.}

\item{method}{A \code{character} signifying which smoothing method that is used for the slope warnings. Valid options include \code{lc} (Local-Average kernel smoothing) and \code{ll} (Local-Linear kernel smoothing).}

\item{tol_median_slope}{A \code{double} value. What is the warning threshold for the median slope warning?}

\item{tol_hyper_slope}{A \code{double} value. What is the warning threshold for the hyper slope warning?}

\item{tol_hypo_slope}{A \code{double} value. What is the warning threshold for the hypo slope warning?}

\item{tol_median_bias}{A \code{double} value. What is the warning threshold for the median month-year bias warning?}

\item{tol_hyper_bias}{A \code{double} value. What is the warning threshold for the hyper month-year bias warning?}

\item{tol_hypo_bias}{A \code{double} value. What is the warning threshold for the hypo month-year bias warning?}

\item{tol_pg}{A \code{double} value. What is the warning threshold for the median peer group bias warning?}

\item{dur}{A \code{integer} value. How many days must the gradient be above the threshold given in \code{tol} in order to trigger a slope warning. Will be the same for all measures for the slope warning.}

\item{bw1}{A \code{double}. The bandwidth used for the kernel smoothing. Typically set to 11.}

\item{bw2}{A \code{double}. The bandwidth used for monthly moving median. Typically set to 30.}

\item{bw3}{A \code{double}. The bandwidth used for yearly moving median. Typically set to 365.}

\item{only_warnings}{A \code{logical} value. If set to \code{TRUE}, only the dates with warnings generated are outputted. If set to \code{FALSE}, the whole process it outputted.}
